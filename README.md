# Covid-19-Sao-Paolo
As part of the CoronaHack Hackathon, our team focussed on trying to estimate the disease severity of a patient in order to predict whether they require hospital admission or admission into the ICU. We used the Sao-Paolo dataset from Brazil. My model focused on using Neural Networks. The dataset was analysed and cleaned resulting in 602 rows and 21 features. Covid-19 was used as a feature so we had more data. Dependant variable, 'Severity', was generated by looing at whether the patient was in the ward or not or in the ICU. I converted this to ordinal data from categorical.
